I am a computer science major at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. I mainly work with TypeScript and React, but I'm not afraid to spread my wings to explore other languages and technologies.

Recently, I've started playing with:

- Astro (this site)
- Deno
- Self-hosting

And I'd love to get into:

- Rust
- Go
- Serious functional programming
